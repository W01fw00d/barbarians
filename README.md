To try it, just open the main.html file with your browser :)

* You can choose the level by using params like this: main.html?level=2
(1 - 10 are for the main campaign, 0 and 11 - XX are for testing)

To launch the Jasmine unit tests, just open SpecRunner.html (please check that all tests are green before launching a pull request :) )


- Launch Cypress (Functional Tests)

```
npm run f-test
```

Launch with ui

```
npm run f-test-ui
```
