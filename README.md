# How to play

Just open the `index.html` file with your browser of choice üëç

## Features details:

- Hover a unit to display a tooltip with extra information
- You can drag and drop a Roman soldier to move it, or just select it and then click where do you want to move it

# Url Params (cheat codes):

- Choose the map/level: `index.html?level=2`
  (1 - 10 are used for the main campaign, 0 and 11 - XX are used for testing)
- Mute the story narration on startup: `index.html?muteNarration`
- Disable animations on startup: `index.html?disableAnimations`
- Disable modals (pop-ups) on startup: `index.html?disableModals`

Example (useful for manual testing):

```
index.html?level=12&muteNarration&disableAnimations&disableModals
```

# How to test

To launch the Jasmine unit tests, just open `SpecRunner.html` (please check that all tests are green before launching a pull request üòÄ).

- Note: some Jasmine tests are currently disabled after a refactor.
- Note 2: Cypress runs the jasmine tests in one of its specs.

* Launch Cypress (Functional Tests)

```
npm run f-test
```

Launch with ui

```
npm run f-test-ui
```

- This project code has been formatted by default prettier
